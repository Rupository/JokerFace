Develop a platform for poker
- At least 2 modalities
	1. Poker bot, opponent level easy/med/hard
		- 1 round play - see what happens in one round with a comp with a given algo (slow game)
		- Then, a way to simulate a lot of games together and see how the algo performs (simulated runs)
	2. Bot vs Bot (diff algos for each)
		- Slow Game
		- Simulated
- Python Script will be the function
- Students map state of the game to an action
	- Four functions: pre flop, post-flop, turn and river
	- Initial features
		- Test out their strategy: slowly see the game play after setting a strategy
		- Play against better AI bot
		- Make bots fight against each other
			- Tourney
	- Platform for playing out strats
	- Grows in complexity over time
- Make a GUI (easy)
- Making an interpreter like https://www.pythonsandbox.com/ for the users to upload the bots
