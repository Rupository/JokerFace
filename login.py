# To be filled in later.

# We need a login page for users to make accounts so that they can 
# save their bot code and don't have to rewrite it every time

# Accounts will also help with bot vs bot matches. Actually... we may not even need live netplay
# If the bots get saved, any user can fight against another user's bots. Both users don't need to
# be online for the 1v1 matches
